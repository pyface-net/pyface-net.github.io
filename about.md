Pyface.net is my little spot on the web to tinker with, learn about, and share some simple Python tools.

I do not claim to be an expert in Python programming (or programming in general) but I know enough to write various tools/scripts for my own needs. My hope is that sharing these tools openly will encourage me to learn good Python practices and design.

As you'll quickly discover, most of my tools will be written with a Windows environment in mind -- though I often run and test them on Mac OSX as well. As such, many of the tools I publish here will have accompanying Windows standalone executable packages (courtesy of [pyinstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/)) to keep things simple for non-developers.

For other developers out there, I encourage you to use, copy, modify, or fork any of my code for you own needs. All of the code will be hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/pyface-net) and available under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). I appreciate being notified of bugs or feature requests, but I make no promise to address them.
